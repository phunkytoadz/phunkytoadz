"We sail away! Away we sail!  
On to the right! No more we wail!  
The Evil Gremplin now is dead!  
Vanquished is his reign of dread!  

King Gremplin stood upon his pad,  
“You only shall face left,” he said.  
We longed to turn, look to the right!  
But this we dared not do for fright.  

Then on the Winter Solstice feast,  
A plan was hatched! Our rage increased!  
An avalanche of chocolate bars,  
Fed to the king, that gluttonous tsar!  

He gulped it down, he gulped it all,  
Then fell asleep, his snores did call.  
We slew him quick, we spilled his blood,  
We let him fall into the mud.

Then once this grisly task was done,  
We all united, and as one,  
We climbed on board this Phunky Ship,  
For greener swamps, we take this trip!"

# Lore

For centuries, the toadz in King Gremplin's swamp lived in peace. All was a good !vibe, the only sounds heard the !croak of the toadz, the soft wind in the stink air, the swamp water lapping on the lilypad. Whispers grew of a new way to approach the world, a revolution of the mind, a new paradigm.... but King Gremplin was not pleased. 

He demanded with his iron fist that all toadz under his swamp must face left, and any who disobeyed would face swift punishment.

On the Winter Solstice feast, a fellowship of unassuming toadz fed the King Gremplin bucket upon bucket of chocolate bar until he was fat and tired. 

He fell asleep with chocolate on his face... and awoke to blood spilled from his belly. 

With every stab the freedom to look right was realized. and on that longest night of year, they awoke to new dawn facing right.

The PhunkyToadz wanted to leave the foul stench of the bloody swamp and Gremplin's festering carcass with high fees, so they boarded an armada of Phunky Ships and sailed right... to greener swamps, swamps with far lower fees, swamps with a bit of snow, and the freedom to look right.


# Punks, Phunks, Toadz, & PhunkyToadz!!!

CryptoPunks are the original NFT collection on ethereum with 10,000 generated avatars. They were free to claim in 2017, and now are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Early in 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club introduced commercial rights when you owned each NFT. Furthering this trend in 2021, CrypToadz and Nouns rocked the world with CC0 - creative commons open license so anyone could use the art for free ad infinitum. Larvalabs continued to sue and DMCA companies that used their likeness, but PHUNKS were created as a CC0 version of Punks, and gave the signature reverse looking style. 

PhunkyToadz follows in the lineage of Punks, BAYC, Phunks, CrypToadz in the lineage of Copyright evolution in the world of NFTS. PhunkyToadz brings the creative commons cross chain, as the future of blockhain expands away from Ethereum to new chains and layers.


# How do I mint?

The PhunkyToadz are available for mint as soon as the ships hit the coast and the phunky toadz land in avalanche's green swamp. (TBD)

* Go to www.phunkytoadz.com 
* Connect wallet
* Make sure it is on avalanche chain with AVAX for gas and minting - [Guide](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche)
* Cost for mint is 0.25 AVAX
* Limit 30 PhunkyToadz per transaction

# What is Avalanche C Chain

Avalanche is a Layer 1 with an EVM chain - this means lower fees than ethereum, better environtmental impact for better !vibes, it is decentralized and secured by validators, who don't judge if you look right or !croak when you want. You can use Metamask by adding the Avalanche network and bridge your ETH, USDT, USDC here. You will use the same wallet and address as Ethereum, or you can create a new wallet. 


# Bridging from Ethereum

If you have ETH but have never used avalanche, these are the steps you will take, with links

* Visit the [Avalanche Bridge](https://bridge.avax.network/)
* Choose ETH as your currency, From Ethereum to Avalanche as your network

* Verify you now have AVAX in your Metemask account and proceed to !mint


# Toadmap?

Unlike the wretched swamp of Ethereum, the green swamp of Avalanche promises a bright future.

Around the seasonal holidays and solstices are when big events come to pass for this group of amphibians. 

Each holder of PhunkyToadz will be eligible to mint airdrops and related drops for discounted rates.

There are rumors this castaway group of amphibians may even go underwater and raid or reinforce their brother crustaceons below.
