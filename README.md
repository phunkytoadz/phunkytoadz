# Lore

For centuries, the toadz in King Gremplin's swamp lived in peace. All was a good !vibe, the only sounds heard the !croak of the toadz, the soft wind in the stink air, the swamp water lapping on the lilypad. Whispers grew of a new way to approach the world, a revolution of the mind, a new paradigm.... but King Gremplin was not pleased. 

He demanded with his iron fist that all toadz under his swamp must face left, and any who disobeyed would face swift punishment.

On the Winter Solstice feast, a fellowship of unassuming toadz fed the King Gremplin bucket upon bucket of chocolate bar until he was fat and tired. 

He fell asleep with chocolate on his face... and awoke to blood spilled from his belly. 

With every stab the freedom to look right was realized. and on that longest night of year, they awoke to new dawn facing right.

The PhunkyToadz wanted to leave the foul stench of the bloody swamp and Gremplin's festering carcass with high fees, so they boarded an armada of Phunky Ships and sailed right... to greener swamps, swamps with far lower fees, swamps with a bit of snow, and the freedom to look right.

# What is Avalanche C Chain

Avalanche is a Layer 1 with an EVM chain - this means lower fees than ethereum, better environtmental impact for better !vibes, it is decentralized and secured by validators, who don't judge if you look right or !croak when you want. You can use Metamask by adding the avlanche network and bridge your ETH, USDT, USDC here. You will use the same wallet and address as Ethereum, or you can create a new wallet. 

# How do I mint?

The PhunkyToadz are available for mint as soon as the ships hit the coast and the phunky toadz land in avalanche's green swamp. (TBD)

# Toadmap?

Unlike the wretched swamp of Ethereum, the green swamp of Avalanche promises a bright future.
