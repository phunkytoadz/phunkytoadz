"We sail away! Away we sail!  
On to the right! No more we wail!  
The Evil Gremplin now is dead!  
Vanquished is his reign of dread!  

King Gremplin stood upon his pad,  
“You only shall face left,” he said.  
We longed to turn, look to the right!  
But this we dared not do for fright.  

Then on the Winter Solstice feast,  
A plan was hatched! Our rage increased!  
An avalanche of chocolate bars,  
Fed to the king, that gluttonous tsar!  

He gulped it down, he gulped it all,  
Then fell asleep, his snores did call.  
We slew him quick, we spilled his blood,  
We let him fall into the mud.

Then once this grisly task was done,  
We all united, and as one,  
We climbed on board this Phunky Ship,  
For greener swamps, we take this trip!"

For centuries, the toadz in King Gremplin's swamp lived in peace. All was a good !vibe, the only sounds heard the !croak of the toadz, the soft wind in the stink air, the swamp water lapping on the lilypad. Whispers grew of a new way to approach the world, a revolution of the mind, a new paradigm.... but King Gremplin was not pleased.

He demanded with his iron fist that all toadz under his swamp must face left, and any who disobeyed would face swift punishment.

On the Winter Solstice feast, a fellowship of unassuming toadz fed the King Gremplin bucket upon bucket of chocolate bar until he was fat and tired.

He fell asleep with chocolate on his face... and awoke to blood spilled from his belly.

With every stab the freedom to look right was realized. and on that longest night of year, they awoke to new dawn facing right.

The PhunkyToadz wanted to leave the foul stench of the bloody swamp, so they boarded an armada of Phunky Ships and sailed right... to greener swamps and the freedom to look right.


# Punks, Phunks, Toadz, PHAYC & PhunkyToadz!!!

CryptoPunks are the original NFT collection on ethereum with 10,000 generated avatars. They were free to claim in 2017, and now are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Early in 2021, Bored Ape Yacht Club introduced commercial rights when you owned each NFT. Furthering this trend in 2021, CrypToadz and Nouns rocked the world with CC0 - creative commons open license so anyone could use the art for free ad infinitum. Larvalabs continued to sue and DMCA companies that used their likeness, but PHUNKS were created as a CC0 version of Punks, and gave the signature reverse looking style.

PhunkyToadz follows in the lineage of Punks, BAYC, Phunks, PHAYC, CrypToadz in the lineage of Copyright evolution in the world of NFTS.
